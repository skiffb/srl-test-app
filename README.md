# README

This repository is a solution to the test described here: https://gist.github.com/erubboli/f9b4c627b4c8adf651c5dbe762675e4f

To get the application running, after cloning run `rails s` and the application will be hosted at http://localhost:3000

The application is set up to run with mailcatcher in development. Info to view emails can be seen here: 

https://mailcatcher.me/

You will just need to ensure that mailcatcher is installed and running and then emails will be sent to http://127.0.0.1:1080/

Please note that this application is a test solution and not production ready. It is missing tests, UI improvements, and production mailer and image hosting.

It is only intended to be used in development and as a base for providing a live production application.
